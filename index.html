				<h1>Barriers to Inclusion</h1>
				<p>People with disabilities often experience barriers to 
fully participating in conferences and other events. 
An attendee using a wheelchair may find that the 
talk they’ve been looking forward to is up a flight 
of stairs. Someone with low vision may be unable 
to sign up for the sessions they want, due to an 
inaccessible website.</p>
<p>These issues escalate, result in bad word of mouth 
and loss of future revenue, and sometimes must be 
resolved in court.</p>
<p>This type of exclusion usually stems from limited 
knowledge and application of legal obligations, such 
as the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities 
Act. Most organizations also lack staff and resources 
to address access and reasonable accommodation 
needs before, during, and after events</p>
